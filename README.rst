Mopidy
******

Mopidy is an `MPD <http://mpd.wikia.com/>`_ server with a
`Spotify <http://www.spotify.com/>`_ backend. Using a standard MPD client you
can search for music in Spotify's wast archive, manage Spotify play lists and
play music from Spotify.

Mopidy is currently under development. Unless you want to contribute to the
development, you should probably wait for our first release before trying out
Mopidy.
